# Push_Swap

Unlike most previous projects, this one is a bit unique in so far as i removed my use of the trusty libft, on the grounds that the norm has changed at 42 and i
have not yet modified my entire libft to match it. Thus i have created the Minilib, it's just a folder with the libft functions i use most, that has a
corresponding .h file, and .mk file for ease of use, it is compiled in with the rest of project as though it were regular srcs files.
